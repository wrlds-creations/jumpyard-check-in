Use this file to define validation for the current project or milestone.

## Automated Validation

| Command | Purpose | Result | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `npm run validate` | Validate root WRLDS workflow files and skills. | Passed | Passed on 2026-05-18. |
| `npm run roller:env:check` | Confirm Roller env guard passes for local Playground config. | Passed | Passed with local `.env`. |
| `npm run roller:smoke` | Confirm Roller Playground auth works and one read-only request can run. | Passed | Passed with local `.env`; `/products` returned HTTP 200 and an empty JSON array summary. |

## Manual Validation

| Test | Expected Result | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Source-of-truth document review | A new Codex session can understand Sprint 1 scope and constraints without chat history. | Pending | Review root source-of-truth docs. |

## Roller Playground Validation

| Test | Expected Result | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Credential smoke test | `npm run roller:smoke` confirms whether local Playground credentials can obtain auth and read one harmless endpoint. | Passed | Local `.env` passes guard and `/products` returns HTTP 200. |
| Expected success case | Playground-looking config and valid credentials pass. | Passed | Uses ROLLER's `https://api.play.roller.app` Playground pattern. |
| Production URL rejection | Production/live-looking URL fails before token or read request. | Passed | Production/live-looking URL was rejected before auth/read call. |
| Missing credentials failure | Missing `ROLLER_CLIENT_ID` or `ROLLER_CLIENT_SECRET` fails with a helpful message. | Passed | Blank credentials were rejected without printing secrets. |

## Staff Handoff Validation

| Test | Expected Result | Status | Notes |
